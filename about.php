                 <p style="font-size:14px ;color:rgb(61, 61, 61);line-height:40px;">"Every child is an artist".It is the place for an creative minds and  teach art to kids.We sharpen every child to be an successful artist that make them to be confident in realife.
                 Kids learns to think big ,creative ,observe ,analyze with arts.Every child can feel pride in his or her original artistic creations.All the kids have potential to everything. Art is not an exceptional thing to do. We also believe Art is not the born skill it’s the skill to be learned. 
                 Smarts Arts mission to teach arts to every kids and make them a successful artist. Kids learn to think big, creative, observe, analyze with arts.
                  These all qualities make them get confidence and successful in life.   </p>    <p style="font-size:14px ;color: rgb(61, 61, 61);line-height:40px;">
                  Creativity won't just increase your child's chances of becoming the next Picasso. It will help them to become future scientists, engineers, designers, architect and mathematicians.
            A report says that young people who participate regularly in the arts are four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement. Kids can develop their creativity, problem-solving, motor skills and critical-thinking skill.

Left brain learners are logical, linear thinkers and tend to have strong auditory and language skills. Right brain learners are visual spatial thinkers, who learn Visual Arts, dance & music and think conceptually.
Mostly school curriculum is left brain based (Science, math)If children's are learning Art they can use both sides of the brain equally that leads them to be smarter student.
Most important perhaps, when kids feel good while they are creating, art helps boost self-confidence,and children who feel able to experiment and to make mistakes feel free to invent new ways of thinking, which extends well beyond the craft room.” Kids will be smarter with Arts”
Our mission is make all the kids to be great artist.</p>              </div>
