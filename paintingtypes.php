Art  is the most beautiful way to bring the imaginations 
and creativity of artists in front of the world. The art is
 as old as human civilizations, and the prehistoric rock 
 paintings on cave walls and ceilings found in many parts 
  the world still continue to fascinate art lovers. During 
  the medieval age, various forms of painting flourished   
in different parts of the world. Notable among them were Indian, Islamic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Western paintings.
A painting always describes the artist's impression of a scene or person. It also describes the artist's feelings about the art of painting itself. Many factors have influenced the history of painting. Geography, religion, national characteristics, historic events, the development of new materials—all help to shape the artist's vision. Throughout history, painting has mirrored the changing world and our ideas about it. In turn, artists have provided some of the best records of the development of civilization, sometimes revealing more than the written word.</p>
